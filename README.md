- Developer, fullstack by definition, currently focused in React and UX
- Passionate about learning, really! Did you know you can tell the steel temperature by the color it glows? And that one of the ways to prove a scientific theory is to prove that you cannot say it's wrong (in extremely simple words)? Nice, huh?
- Father of three amazing kids
- Husband of a super talented [baker](https://deulicias.com) <3
